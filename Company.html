			The company was started in 2010 to address the fuel challenges that our transport industry faces. This is mainly due to exorbitant fuel prices. Moto Green has partnered with Novo energy, a company with over 20 years of experience in CNG - a greener fuel alternative. CNG is obtained from methane gases released at our landfill sites.<br>
				<br> Moto Green's role is to Market and Distribute the CNG to the transport sector, mainly the taxi industry. Whilst working on this project Mr. Chetty the Former CEO of the Taxi Cooperative that oversees all the Associations in and around Port Elizabeth, who is also the founder of Moto Green was assisting and consulting with the Regional taxi Council regarding the scholar transport in the Eastern Cape. It was then concluded that there is an extreme urgency to find a solution to the transportation challenges that the rural communities face.<br> It is not only scholar transport, but transportation in general. Working closely with his Indian associates regarding the CNG project (70% of India's public transport is running on CNG) Mr. Chetty discovered that the Indians through Low Cost Mobility addressed their rural transportation challenges for the past 30 years. The three wheeler has successfully addressed these challenges that rural and urban communities faced with a Low Cost Commercial vehicle, presently there are over 5 million three wheelers servicing the Poor today. After long discussions and negotiations, the manufacturers agreed to extend their capacity and supply these vehicles into South Africa. Not only to supply, but also train and equip us with the necessary expertise.

							In India, back in the 1970's when transportation was a crucial problem especially in rural areas, Mr. Jagjivanbhai Karsanbhai Chandra decided to blaze a new trail. He was thinking of an affordable mode of transportation, which could benefit rural folks of Saurashtra. The conditions of the roads were not good but, the need for transportation was increasing day by day. After thorough research and planning, he came up with a vehicle, which was skillfully engineered, from a motorcycle. This is how the first 'chhakada' was developed which later became a way of life for the people of Saurashtra GUJARAT-INDIA.<br>
							<br>
							The Late Mr. Jagjivanbhai Karsanbhai Chandra was a man of vision. A Dreamer, An Inventor, A Strategist and an ingenious mastermind who loved challenges. The improvements in technologies were done from time to time to make it a sturdy and Comfortable vehicle and like father like son, Mr. Jayantibhai Chandra also joined this Mission. He took his illustrious father's vision further by introducing the diesel 'chhakada' with many new features and soon after that 150,000 'chhakadas' were to be seen all over Saurashtra.<br>
							<br>
Our passion did not end with success of 'chhakada'. The Group's main focus was now to engineer a similar product for semi-urban and urban areas. The 'Shakti' was born and on the road, which proved to be a runaway success just like like the half tonner, Commercial 3-wheeler, and more were also introduced under the brand name of Shakti.<br>
<br> Atul Auto Ltd. is the largest manufacturer of three wheelers in the Gujarat Province having its manufacturing facility at Rajkot in the state of Gujarat. Atul produces Diesel as well as CNG operated Three Wheeled Micro Commercial vehicles.<br> Apart from Atul Gem, Atul manufactures, markets and exports both, Cargo and Passenger three wheelers under the brand name "ATUL SMART".<br> More than 300,000 Atul vehicles are on the Indian roads as well as foreign roads with commendable success. This success is seen both in terms of workmanship and after sales service through our well spread Authorized Dealer's Network operating in 17 Indian Provinces with a Dealers strength of around 140 Authorized Dealers for Sales, Service and Spares.<br>
<br>
Now Atul Auto Ltd. is all set to spread their wings in South Africa.
The Grand Launch of Atul three wheelers was held in SAAW - PE - South Africa in October 2012.
ATUL Gem three wheelers will be assembled in PE by (DAS) Dynamic Automotive Systems and will be distributed & marketed by Moto Green. Over the years, the world has bared witness to the amazing development in the sector of three wheeler industry. It is believed that, numerous people have been employed in various countries due to these three wheelers. Apart from serving the daily needs of the commuters, the three wheelers also play a commendable role in the transportation of several commodities. South Africa has tremendous potential for development in the automobile sector. We have confidence in our products and their performance - which will again prove to provide various Empowerment opportunities by using our three wheelers in South Africa.
